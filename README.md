# SneakyEmotes
 
This is the emote mod for the SneakyRP community. It borrows heavily from the code of the Quark mod.

List of additions:

* Removed all the unused modules since we are only interested in the emotes right now (ongoing)
* Remove the popup that happens when you emote
* Hotkey emotes now loop when you keep the key held down
* Hotkey emotes no longer reset on key inputs
* Mouse buttons can now be used as hotkeys
* Added a /e or /emote command. Example "/e wave"
* Part offsets and model offsets now scale with your MorePlayerModels body size
* Added a new emote catagory "Blockbench emote" which parses blockbench .json files instead of quark .emote files
* Added /ce or /cancelemote command that cancels emotes
